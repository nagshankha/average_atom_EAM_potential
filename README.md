# Synthesize Average-atom EAM potential from a multicomponent EAM potential

This code synthesizes an EAM potential with a new fictitious atom-type called Average-atom,generated by concentration wieghted averaging of the embedding and pair terms of the multicomponent EAM potentials. Interactions of the Average atom with real atom type from the potential are also defined. Details on the Average-atom method can be found in the following two papers:
